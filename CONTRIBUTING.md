## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

### Setting up for local testing

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   NOTION_TOKEN=your_test_token_here
   ```

2. Create a test configuration file `notion.config.yml`:
   ```yaml
   databases:
     - databaseId: "your-test-database-id"
       srcDir: "test-output/posts"
       srcDirImages: "test-output/images"
       basePath: "/test"
       layout: "layouts/test.njk"
   ```

3. Test the CLI:
   ```bash
   node src/cli.js
   ```

4. Test the library:
   ```javascript
   const { exportNotionToSSG } = require('./src/index.js');
   // Your test code here
   ```

## Making Changes

### Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use double quotes for strings
